## Age 15

The idea came to me to create a **platform** for **professionals** such as *restaurateurs, bakers, butchers, etc.*, to hire **freelancers** for both physical and non-physical tasks. The goal was to enable **local businesses in Lyon** to engage and recruit **freelancers** for microservices, such as social media management, food photography, or even menu creation for events.

### Project
Unfortunately, this project is now **obsolete** and no longer under active development, despite the **initial** interest from some VCs/LoveMoney. Attention has refocused on developing **PiglyAgency**, which I was starting to set up.

### Business Model
The envisioned **business model** was based on a **commission** taken from each service, straightforward.
